# Sword Combat (the role playing game) Simulator for Discord ⚔️
**WIP** currently working offline. Haven't uploaded anything yet

## Planned Features ☑️
1. Attack execution with reaction system
2. Embed based interface that is both easy to read and understand
3. Data base for storing learned / selected moves + a gacha system to obtain them
_And much more!_

## Dates & Deadlines 📆
TBA. I've been pretty busy with my studies.
