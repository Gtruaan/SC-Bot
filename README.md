# Sword Combat simulator for Discord ⚔️
**WIP** currently working offline. Haven't uploaded anything yet

__Planned Features__ ☑️
1. Attack execution with reaction system
2. Embed based interface that is both easy to read and understand
3. Data base for storing learned / selected moves + a gacha system to obtain them
_And much more!_

__Dates & Deadlines__ 📆
TBA. I've been pretty busy with my studies.
